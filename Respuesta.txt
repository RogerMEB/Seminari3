Seminari 3

Of the diferent codecs i have tried in this seminari, clearly the worst of all was VP8, and because of that
there is already an improved version, vp9. Between vp9, h265 and av1 there was not much difference.
Specially between the last two. However av1 takes a long time in converting, so svtav1 is an aproximation 
that can be used in order not to wait many minutes for the program to execute.
